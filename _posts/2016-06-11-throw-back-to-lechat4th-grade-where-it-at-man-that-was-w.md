  Throw back to LeChat,4th grade where it at!? Man, that was waaay back. Before
  i made my first stack, before responsibilities on my back, before my abilities
  put me on lifeâ€™s track, a little bit of this, little but of that. Before
  paying taxes and vat. Memory from the past, somebody callin back, sticks to me
  like a tat, ratatat the sound of a rhyme attack, like a loaded gat, watch out
  for the kickback, i'm all that, im smoken im toking, get buzzed on the
  blowback.

Throw back to LeChat,4th grade where it at!? Man, that was waaay back. Before i made my first stack, before responsibilities on my back, before my abilities put me on life's track, a little bit of this, little but of that. Before paying taxes and vat. Memory from the past, somebody callin back, sticks to me like a tat, ratatat the sound of a rhyme attack, like a loaded gat, watch out for the kickback, i'm all that, im smoken im toking, get buzzed on the blowback.

Moved beforr du Leman because i had to travel the monde

Family moved so i had to come along

International school, same ol dance and song

Keep moving on, looking for a place to belong

Done some right,but did alot wrong

Burned bright, but also burned in the shaft of a bong

Instead of making new rules, i just played along

Not an individual, just someone who falls

So pick up the pieces and march on

****

And do real things before your life is gone

Found myself across the sea under white stones in DC. 

From sea to shining sea, i fell into belief 

That this is where i be, the roots to grow my tree

But then making innercity runs into MD

To serendipitously roaming through NC

To pleasurably tasting my buds in Stockholm city.

Swedish pussy such sweet slussy. So juicy so mushy. Let me get a lil tushy. Makes me want you cussin me You try to rush me You can try and push me but i wont finish trust me So lusciously tasting lustfully. Must fill me Your my medicine so pill me Get down and dirty like a hillbilly Get you so wet you have your hands up screaming "Free Willy!" I know for real, its so illy Oooh,you got goosepumps its so chilly Great time, lets do it again next Wednesday 

Coincidentally finding my destiny when we are not one city but a unity. 

Cuz baby aint nothin like baby blues see. 

Give me sight so we can see 

Give me strength so we can break free. 

Give me heart so i can be me.
