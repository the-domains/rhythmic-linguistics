****

**Sunblind**

I just want to stay in the sun

Just to find a piece of mind

Sometimes it gets all undone

Trying to find it, push rewind

****

In the sunlight, it gets blinding

Because you are used to dark

In the floodlight, its unwinding

Chasing the sun when you just need a spark

****

Falling down those rabbit holes

Always running to a wonderland

Always diving past the shoals

Looking for where Alice ran

****

Just stay on the sands of the beach

Why must you be swimming in the deep

Always going beyond your reach

Parts of me that never sleep

****

A rolling stone gathers no moss

A tumbleweed has no roots

That is always the cost

To wandering boots

****

I see a lovely ol girl

Filled with scent of perfume

Give her a move, a twirl

Make her mine in the room

****

Jealousies brewing

Emotions feuding

Blinding lights

Fluid nights 

Strip downs 

To breakdowns

It all comes around

Sometimes you pull the shortest straw

Sometimes you get it all

Sometimes you fall

So run with the ball

Before the curtain call

****

**_Doubt(full)_**

Sometimes my head is filled with so much doubt

Deep mines leading to tunnels i cant crawl out

Faultlines so deep i cant hear myself shout

Cant find the switch with all these lights out

****

Doubt is the demon that haunts me

It finds me when i am lonely

It blinds me when i should see

It binds me when i should be free

****

Grips me between being a boy and a man

My footing between soil and quicksand

My future in disarray or a laid out plan

My voice between silence and a band

****

Time to break the walls of my prison

Take off the blindfold to my vision

Leave the fire of Hell's Kitchen

Confront your sins and get redemption

****

To all the burned bridges of your connections

To all the voided holes of your recollections

Make amends with your silent confessions

To the ones that need your protection

****

So don't just float in the blue motionless

Don't just cope with the loneliness

Dont numb yourself and be emotionless

Don't drown your dreams in hopelessness

****

Doubtful, where is your mind?

Mouthful, where is your pride?

Scoundrel, where is your stride?

Powerful, is the rising tide

****

Remove the noose that is constricting

The air in your lungs,your voice is restricting

The walls and ceiling you've made are limiting

Remove the doubt, and live where you are benefiting

****

Remove the doubt and believe in self

Do what is best for you and your health

Remove the shackles keeping you from wealth

****

Write your pages, shake the dust off from your shelf.
